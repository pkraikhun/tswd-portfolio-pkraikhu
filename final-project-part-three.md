# The final data story
The full page of the story on Unpacking the Surge:Why Electricity Prices in Thailand Keep Rising is available through this [link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/unpacking-the-surge/index.html). 

The story started with introducing the electricity price components. Then, the variable rate (FT) which is the source of the rise will be discussed. After that, depleting domestic natural gas production is identified as the causes of the rise in FT. The story is followed by the impact it has on the economics. Finally, the solution which is the change to renewable energy is introduced and the call to action would be awareness and support in shifting to more sustainable sources.

# Changes made since Part II
According to the user research in part II, there are some comments and suggestion to improve clarity and make the story more impactful. I've identified those and make changes in the following items
- revise the domestic NG chart title to reflect the message and make it easier for the reader to understand the information presented.
- font size of charts elements are adjusted to complement the main story
- the unit of FT chart is added to make it more clear
- before transitioning to the call to action, information to guide readers to the proposed solution is added. 

## The audience
This story is aimed at the electricity consumer and household owner in Thailand, with the goal of providing information about the factors contributing to high electricity prices and raising awareness of the shift towards more renewable energy sources. It also highlights the impact beyond houshold electricity bills to economics as a whole.

## Final design decisions
I decided to start the story in the darker colors with yellow and white accents to provide the bad impression and brighten the story up to the solution at the end. There are pages with highlighted important statistics to keep it clean from busy text and charts. For example, the call out that 50% of electricity is from natural gas. The story also includes multiple questions along the way to guide and transition the story into different sections. 

# Final thoughts
Creating this story about high electricity prices in Thailand has been an interesting journey. Improvements are made based on user feedback, making charts and data clearer. Colors and questions are used to guide the story from problems to solutions. I wish we had more time to dive deeper into the renewable energy solution and practical steps for consumers which will make the story even more compelling. What excites me most is the potential to raise awareness and inspire action. High electricity prices affect everyone, and shifting to renewable energy is not only smart but also necessary for the environment. In the end, I hope this story helps people in Thailand understand the issue and encourages them to support sustainable energy solutions.
