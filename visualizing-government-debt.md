# Assignment: Visualizing government debt

## Part I: Web-based Visualization Tools

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7b5S" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7b5S" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2020</a></iframe>

This visualization shows general government debt of each country in Europian Union as % of GDP in 2020. The highlighted bars are countries in Northern Europe.

## Part II: Flourish - Grid of Line Charts

This visualization shows grid of line charts of general government debt as % of GDP from 1995 to 2019.

## Part III: Flourish - Heatmap

While the bar chart in part I makes the comparison between level of debt between countries easy for the readers, it only shows one year of each country not reflecting the changes through time. On the other hand, the grid of line charts (part II) visualize the level of debt of each country separately with year as x-axis making it easier to spot trend. However, the comparison between countries becomes more difficult even though the y-axis range is the same. The readers have to scan through all charts to determine which country has the largest debt to GDP. The third chart, heatmap, proides the benefit of comparing level of debt using colors in country level as well as throughout the period of interest.

From this dataset, I started with the full heatmap plot with all countries and years available and noticed that Japan has been experiencing high debt level starting in 2000s. Therefore, to make the story, I pick the group of countries that are powerful and leading the world's economy, i.e. G7, as a comparison while removing other countries. As mentioned that the high debt level of Japan started in 2000s, the information of years before that is also filtered out. Hence, the heatmap along with the title and subtitle highlights the fact that despite being one of the world's advanced economy, Japan has much higher debt level compared with other countries in similar position.
