# Outline 

This project focuses on the rise of electricity price in Thailand in recent years. This topic impacts the whole country economy both in household and business sectors. I want to point out the cause of the problem and suggest potential solutions to the general public to raise awareness and support for the change. 

The story will start by introducing the electricity price components which includes base rate, variable rate, service charge and VAT. Then, the variable rate (FT) which is the source of the rise will be discussed. The main cause of the raise in FT is the depleting domestic natural gas supply which is the main source of electricity production. The decline leads to more reliance on imported NG and LNG which are more expensive and volatile to market price and exchange rate. Then, the story is followed by the impact it has on the economics. Finally, the call to action would be awareness and support in shifting to more sustainable sources. 

## Project Structure

The story starts off neutral with providing information. Then, it starts dropping from the rise in the variable price, the depleting domestic supply which worsen the situation and hits the lowest point at the potential economic impacts of the high electricity price. Finally, the story rises up from the call to action that in long run, the situation could be better with renewable energy.

## Initial sketches

Electricity price – elements 
Electricity bill consists of 4 elements
1.	Progressive Base Rate – adjusted every 3-5 years by Office of Energy Regulatory Commission
   Planned cost according to the CAPEX, OPEX under assumptions on electricity consumption, exchange rate and inflation rate
2.	Variable Rate: Fuel Adjustment Charge (FT) – adjusted every 4 months by Office of Energy Regulatory Commission
   Based on difference between planned and actual cost of fuel, exchange rate and other investments
3.	Service Charge – flat rate per month per meter
4.	VAT (7%) by law

Most part of the electricity price remain constant in the past 5 years, except the FT which causes the rising electricity bills beginning last year.

Thailand primarily derives its natural gas from domestic production (over 50% in 2022), which provides a degree of stability against market price fluctuations and exchange rate volatility. Nonetheless, the domestic supply experienced a significant 35% decline from its peak in 2014 by the year 2022. This decline has led to an escalating dependence on imported natural gas in the form of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), which is susceptible to market price fluctuations denominated in USD.

According to projections from the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO), Thailand is expected to escalate its LNG imports by 10% annually. By the year 2037, a significant 71% of the country's natural gas supply is anticipated to come from these imported LNG sources. This growing reliance on imports underscores the importance of monitoring global energy markets and exchange rates for Thailand's energy security and economic stability.

Impact of high electricity price
The high electricity price hike in Thailand will have significant impacts:

-	Economic Competitiveness & Comparative Costs: The price increase may undermine Thailand's competitiveness and attractiveness for businesses due to significantly higher power costs compared to neighboring countries.
-	Manufacturing and Services Sector: Businesses may raise prices, impacting sectors still in recovery.
-	Inflation Increase & Interest Rates: This could push up inflation, potentially reaching 3.5% next year, and may lead to higher interest rates, affecting the overall economic environment.

Call to action: Shift to renewable energy which are more sustainable, less volatile to FX and petrochemical price

# The data
I gathered price and production statistics from Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) and Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand which are the main organizations reponsible for the production, distribution and planning the electricity in Thailand.

# Method and medium
I plan to use Shorthand as a main story borad to show text, images and visualizations to readers. The charts are drafted using excel, but I expect to use Flourish/ Tableau or other tools that can be embedded in the html format to create interactive graph allowing readers to get more detail from the visualizations.
